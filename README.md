# PKH Database Application

This web application was developed during my time as a Software Developer for the Family of Hope Program (Program Keluarga Harapan; PKH) under the Social Welfare Ministry of Indonesia. This project involved the creation of a database system that allows workers from the Central Java branch of the organization to remotely store data and produces data visualizations for ease of analysis. I took leadership for this project as my role in this project was both to assess the organization's needs through interviewing key members of the organization and was the lead in creating the solution. Throughout this project, I coded the Application in Java whilst utilizing JavaFX, CSS, and XSSFSheet Library as main frameworks to build this Application.
